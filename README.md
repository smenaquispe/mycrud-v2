# mycrud-v2

It's my crud version 2, obviously better thant v1

## Demo
Backend deployed on railway [link](https://mycrud-v2-production.up.railway.app/tasks)
Frontend, it is connected to back, also it was deployed in vercel [link](https://mycrud-v2-gxrg.vercel.app/)

## What do I learn?
I learnt to use react as a framework of js

## techs:
- express
- node
- mongoose
- react js
- react router dom

To initialize the project, neccesary setup two directories

## Backend

- Go to `/backend`
- Install packages with `npm install` 
- Run backend with `npm run start`

## Frontend

- Now you have to go `/app`
- Run this command `npm install`
- Just in case this one `npm run build`
- Finally `npm run dev`

That's it, be happy with this crud
